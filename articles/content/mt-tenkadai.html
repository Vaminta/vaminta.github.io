		<p>Waking up midday on a Sunday isn’t the best feeling when you realise you only got a few hours of sun left before the next sunrises on a Monday. It’s even worse when you are feeling rough after what feels like an invisible battle royale competition for who can catch a cold last.</p>
		
		<p>Waking up at noon is too late to do anything big and too early to go to bed. So I decided to go outside, pick a direction, and keep walking to see where I ended up. I like this kind of adventure, although you can be excused if it’s raining or unpleasant outside.</p>
		
		<p>A day in December that isn’t raining is already a day that is better than average. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem to rain in Hyogo as much as it does on the West coast of Wales during the Winter.</p>
		
		<p>However, I hadn’t long been outside before it started raining, but thankfully, it was clear from looking at the sky that it wouldn’t rain for long.</p>
		
		<p>I had decided today was the day for checking out the Western side of Aioi. I didn’t really mind where I ended up. Although, I did have a goal of finding a decent incline to get a good view of the city.</p>
		
		<p>I probably meandered around for over an hour before I found myself at the base of Mt. Tenkadai.</p>
		
		<p>I only arrived at the south of the mountain at 3:15pm which didn’t leave much time to explore. I wasn’t even planning to reach the top. All I knew up to this point was that the walk to this starting point wasn’t particularly good, partly due to the lack of sidepaths which meant walking along a somewhat busy road for a short while.</p>
		
		<p>Thankfully, the walk up the mountain makes it worthwhile, although you can make the whole journey a bit better if you can get there by car.</p>

		<p>At the beginning, there’s a few signs warning you to be cautious of wild animals, although I only encountered a few humans on the way up. This was a little reassuring given that I was contemplating if it was a bit too late to start making my way up. Mt Tenkadai has clearly got some history behind it and a lot of effort has been put into keeping it maintained and accessible. It also seems to be a popular pilgrimage route although I didn’t have time to see all of the shrines this time. I wasn’t even sure if I had enough time to make it any significant distance up. There are many steps which makes climbing the mountain super easy but their small incline can ironically push your step count even higher and potentially make the climb feel more exhausting at times.</p>

		<p>The view at the top won’t leave you disappointed however. Standing at a modest height of 300 metres, you get an incredible 360-degree view of the surrounding area. From the top you can even see Awaji and surrounding islands as well as the Akashi Kaikyou bridge. A picture from my old smartphone camera couldn’t have done it justice. My phone had already suddenly died after getting a bit cold on the climb up, so it was relying on an external battery for life support.</p>
		
		<p>The sun was setting quick and wouldn’t wait so I didn’t hang around too long before I descended the same route I came up.</p>
		
		<p>Next time I’ll be better prepared and I’m looking forward to seeing what it looks like in spring and summer.</p>
