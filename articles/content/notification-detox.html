		<p>Notifications are a key part of modern day phones and computers. In an ever increasing online world it often makes sense to be alerted when something worthwhile has happened. However, many apps use notification priviledges excessively which I believe can have a negative impact on your day.</p>
		<p>Have you ever reached the end of the day, looked at your phone and become overwhelmed by the huge amount of useless notifications should you ever decide to look? Perhaps you're going about your day until you hear what you assume is a useful alert only to find out it isn't. This wouldn't be so bad if these notifications were actually useful, but most apps don't necessarily care about what you find useful. It's fair to say many popular apps are designed to get you to use them as part of your daily routine as much as possible. One of the most accessible and easiest way of grabbing your attention is by sending frequent notifications whether you actually need them or not.</p>
		
		<h2>Pay Attention to Useless Notifications!</h2>
		
		<p>Rather than making an effort to ignore and dismiss notifications, wouldn't it be better to prevent them from appearing in the first place? At the end of the day you may want to pay attention to what notifications you actually find useful and which ones you don't. Once you have identified ones which you don't need, you can take the necessary steps to either turn them off completely, or make them less intrusive.</p>
		<p>In my case, I dismissed all the notifications I actually found useful and kept the ones I didn't which in turn creates a nice to-do list for notifications I want to disable. I certainly didn't need instagram telling me when random accounts I followed posted to their story. Neither did Snapchat need to let me know I took some pictures on a random November 19th. These types of notifications have a purpose of serving the makers of the app and not myself.</p>
		<p>Sometimes you may need to search online on how to disable a certain notification. For my Instagram example, it wasn't clear which setting needed to be changed so a quick search cleared that up.</p>
		
		<h2>Consider Silent Mode</h2>
		<p>I highly recommend turning your phone onto silent mode - not vibrate! While many people may not find this a realistic option 24/7, you may find periods where you can which can help you focus on other things. For example, you may want to turn your phone on silent over the weekend.</p>
