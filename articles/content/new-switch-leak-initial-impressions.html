		<p>Just as I thought it was almost my turn to post my predictions for the new Switch it seems as though I was interrupted by leaks coming from a Chinese website appearing to present photos of the next generation console from Nintendo. The leaked images already appear to be corroberated by VCG, a reputable gaming news source which adds credibility to these leaks. Another source appears to list detailed shipping information containing some specifications. However, it should be noted that at the time of writing this article none of the leaked information has been confirmed by Nintendo.</p>
		
		<h2>Hardware Information</h2>
		<p>Basic part numbers and information contained in a shipping manifest come from one of the leaked sources:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 3%">
			<tr><td>SoC</td><td>GMLX30-R-A1 (Nvidia Tegra T239)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Memory</td><td>2X6G dual channel, LPDDR5X, 7500MT/s</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Flash Storage</td><td>256GB, UFS 3.1</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>Other parts listed includes the main unit along with two joycons, a dock. The system appears to contain an NFC reader (likely for amiibo), dual cooling fans and stereo speakers.</p>
		
		<p>We still don't appear to have any information regarding the screen resolution, screen technology or battery capacity.</p>
		
		<h2>First Thoughts</h2>
		<p>While this new information cannot be verified, it shows some hopeful specifications. I'm sure the inclusion of 12GB of RAM will come to the relief of many who may have wondered if Nintendo would cut back in this area like they had done with previous consoles such as the Wii U and current Switch. Considering the current gen consoles contain 16GB of memory (except Series S with 12) it seems crucial that the new Switch should have a least 12GB should it want to benefit from third party software support.</p>
		<p>It seems inevitable that Nintendo's new system will be compared with the Steam Deck, an obvious alternative in the portable gaming market with a similar price tag. However Nintendo's approach will likely be to keep power consumption and thus heat to a minimum allowing for a longer playing time. After all, Nintendo's console doesn't need to run PC versions of games. With a strict power limit in place, it will be interesting to see how close the switch can get to the Steam Deck's performance. With the help of upscaling and careful optimisation, it seems quite possible that games could surpass their equivalent on the Steam Deck.</p>
		<p>Nintedo could decide to release two tiers of the system at launch, much like what Microsoft has done with the Series consoles.</p>
		
		<h2>Nintendo's Next Move</h2>
		<p>With the run up to christmas and the ever increasing amount of rumours and leaks appearing on the internet, it would seem logical that Nintendo will make an announcement sooner rather than later.</p>
		<p>Despite all the leaks it seems one thing isn't for certain: the name of the console. Looking back at Nintendo's history, it seems unlikely that the system will be given a sequential name. The Wii 2 became the Wii U, the DS 2, became the DSI, and the third DS became the 3DS (ok, that would sorta works), but you get the point. Given the similarity with the original Switch, it could be the first time Nintendo breaks away from tradition and simply calls it the Switch 2 - what a monumental possibility!</p>
