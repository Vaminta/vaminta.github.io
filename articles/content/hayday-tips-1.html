		<p>Hay Day is a popular mobile game developed by Supercell originally released in 2012. I’ve been playing Hay Day on and off for at least the past decade. Here’s some tips players may find helpful although I am by no means an expert of this game.</p>
	
		<h3>Organise Crop Fields into Uniform Sections</h3>
		
		<p>I find that placing fields into strips of equal size allows me to quickly plant the exact number of crops I want. Having small strip sizes (such as strips of ten) allows you to quickly place down the required number of crops you want to produce rather than slowly, or clumsily going through a big patch.</p>

		<h3>Sell Those Expansion Pieces!</h3>
		
		<p>Have you found yourself loaded with one particular barn, silo or farm expansion piece and none of the others? Well unfortunately this an intentional game mechanic someone at supercell thought would be a good idea. The more of one item you have, the more likely you’ll collect more of that item. Perhaps this was to encourage players to sell excess inventory, however it isn’t an intuitive feature as you might do what I did and assume you got unlucky with a random number generator. The best thing to do in this situation is to give those excess pieces of yours to your fellow neighbourhood members, especially if you’ve got plenty of coins established. If you’re a lower level, it may be an effective way of generating coins. Always sell expansion items for the maximum price as they will always sell instantly (except for some town expansion items).</p>		
		
		<h3>Use Free Boosters Liberally</h3>
		
		<p>Let’s face it, some of the boosters are terrible, however this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use them. In fact, it means you should just use them sooner to make room for newer & better boosters. If you refrain from using free boosters you may find yourself needing to scrap them when you pick up another one when you could have just used it earlier, even if it’s not very helpful.</p>
		
		<h3>Keep a Sufficient Stock of Items</h3>
		
		<p>This may not be possible early game, but once you have built up sufficient barn storage, you should keep a minimum stock of two of each items, with a higher limit for more common items. Those items in frequent demand, such as those from the dairy and sugar machines should be kept in higher quantities so they are ready for whenever you need them. How much stock you keep will obviously depend on how much barn storage you have, but you should aim for at least 4 of each item from the dairy for example, working your way up as you increase in level and barn size. Having a minimum stock level will make the game far less frustrating and more enjoyable to play as you’ll be able to fulfil orders without having to constantly wait for stock to replenish.</p>
		
		<h3>Make Use of Downtime</h3>
		
		<p>One skill tested in Hay Day is how effectively (i.e. efficiently) you can manage time. This is likely obvious, but if you’ll be leaving the game for a period of time (e.g. to sleep or work), be sure to have machines producing stock for as long as possible. Even if you don’t necessarily need the items, you can sell them in the shop for some extra income. I often keep the queue for the furnace and candy machine full since items made with these take a long time to produce.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>These are just some of the strategies that I found useful while playing the game. As you progress, you'll likely pick up strategies of your own.</p>
