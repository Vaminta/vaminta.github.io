		<p>This is the first in a series of reviews which will be conducted potentially years after the product has released. However, this gives a little extra context on how the game has evolved since released and how it has aged in the modern day!</p>
		
		<p>I imagine animal crossing is what would be created if there was a well-produced mobile game without the drawbacks of typical mobile game monetisation. A summary which is probably a little unfair for a game franchise which goes back way before mobile gaming was a concept as we know it now.</p>
		
		<p>The premise is that by purchasing the game, you have in fact purchased a package from Nook Inc. which provides you the services to set up your own remote island which you will be able to colonise with characters, based (sometimes loosely) animals. You start the game by creating your own character from a set of limited customisation options which you can change later from any point in the game. This limited set of options will expand throughout as you can unlock additional options in exchange for in-game currency. Once you have chosen the name of your character and island, you will depart to your newly founded land with two animal buddies who will join you from the start. Since you’re effectively the island’s founder, it is your job to choose where everything on the island goes (excluding a select few structures). Over time you’ll upgrade the accommodation from a very limiting tent, to fully fledged housing with multiple rooms.</p>

		<p>Given the name, the game puts emphasis on the animals who will live on your island as you establish new plots of land for them to purchase. Each animal seemingly has their own set of interests and personalities. One of my favourites being Simon the Monkey who was ecstatic to share a DIY recipe for constructing a bed out of cardboard boxes. Where did he learn of this genius construction idea? The bugs in his messy room whispering to him of course! Characters are brought to life from the excellent localisation and there are multiple occasions I catch myself smiling at my switch like someone through endless cat videos.</p>
		
		<p>As of the writing of this review, I have experienced only the spring season in-game however, all four seasons are featured here, presumably containing exclusive critters and fish for each. It will take at least a year to fully experience what the game has to offer unless one is willing the change the clock on their switch to time travel. Since the game is based in real-world time, it’s not one where you’re going to be sat down for many hours on end unless you are totally engrossed in arranging objects on your island. The main game-loop is essentially to earn money and spend it on decorations, although there is of course a lot of nuance to that. Therefore, I would not recommend this game for those who are looking to put their head down and sink countless hours into long play sessions, rather than shorter more frequent sessions which this game’s design favours. Some of the game’s mechanics have an emphasis on visiting your island each consecutive day to get the most benefits, so perhaps not a bad game to download from the eShop.</p>
		
		<p>Whilst the music isn’t something you’re going to blast on your home stereo, it serves its purpose well here and isn’t quite repetitive enough to make me want to rip my hair out. This is also a game you can comfortably play muted and not be concerned about missing something special. The sound design works very well and there are only a couple sounds which play a bit too frequently for my taste.</p>
		
		<p>The visuals are nothing to write home about either, but the cartoonish theme fits the game perfectly. This relatively simple looks gives it a clean crisp appearance especially when playing in portable mode where it adapts excellently to the Switch’s display. The visual design is perfect for the Switch’s limited SoC so I didn’t encounter any noticeable performance issues which you would hope but can’t guarantee for a game running at 30fps.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, the game does seem to make traversing the island not as fluid as you might expect. Put bluntly one of the game’s biggest issue is the short but frequent loading screens which can make exploring parts the island seem a bit of a chore. Entering or exiting a building and even moving between rooms within a building can trigger a brief yet frustrating pause while you wait for the next tiny room to load. I often found myself thinking twice before entering a building to wonder whether the extra time spent looking at a black screen is worth it. It also discourages you to explore the museum which features lots of rooms split into loading screens which can make what should be leisurely activity seem like a slog. Fortunately, there are no loading screens when exploring the outside world which is where the vast majority of your time will be.</p>
		
		<p>Overall, in the relatively brief time I’ve had to play this game I can say it’s a fun and unique concept that isn’t for everyone. The slow yet relaxing pace makes it an easy game to pick up and play. Personally, I found the game to be an excellent dose of daily escapism where I can not worry about anything other than where the new resident’s house is going to go. If you’re looking for a relaxing game and haven’t tried the animal crossing series before, this would be a perfect time to jump in!</p>
