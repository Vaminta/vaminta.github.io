		<p>Amazon prides itself on being affordable and convenient. Recently, I’ve noticed that Amazon can charge a pretty penny for the convenience they offer. Also, to be clear, this article was written in late October 2024, before being published February 2025.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon is one of few companies I can think of which charge you for being a loyal customer through their loyalty programme (Amazon Prime). Admittedly being an Amazon Prime member does give you more benefits than a typical loyalty scheme at your supermarket would. It’s a unique approach to win your loyalty and may exploit a “sunken cost” psychological effect where you may purchase something from Amazon because you’ve already invested money in Prime delivery.</p>
		
		<p>Anyway, that’s beyond the scope of this article however because I just so happened to have visited a local UK discount store, Home Bargains where I’ve bought various products. I’m going to compare the price of each item to the closest equivalent found on Amazon. You’ll notice a theme with the items here as I’m preparing to move abroad, or rather was preparing to go abroad while writing this article.</p>
		
		<h3>Travel Adaptor</h3>
		
		<p>Perhaps one of the most useful accessories to bring abroad with you is a travel adaptor. I found a decent one in store for £0.99. This a USA type A to UK socket adaptor. This type A variant includes an earth pin which makes it slightly preferable to a type B adaptor. However, many older buildings in Japan do not have any, or at least many type B sockets so I did end up buying some unearthed adapters later.</p>
		
		<p>The cheapest equivalent adaptor I could find from Amazon was £5.99 which of course doesn’t include delivery unless you already pay for an Amazon Prime subscription. For the sake of these comparisons I’ll give Amazon a benefit and exclude delivery costs. The “Xoltz” USA – UK adaptor does dispatch from Amazon, so delivery is included for Prime members.</p>
		
		<h3>Digital Luggage Scale</h3>
		
		<p>Having a luggage scale is useful for checking you stay within weight limits before arriving at the check-in desk at the airport. I found a rather common looking design in Home Bargains for £4.99 with “TravelShop” branding. I remember seeing this design quite a lot when searching online previously so it was rather easy to find a comparable item on Amazon. </p>
		
		<p>The cheapest equivalent on Amazon was £4.01 but this came with a mandatory delivery charge of £3.90, making it more expensive than an Amazon prime option which cost £5.99 - £1 more than the in-store version. It looks like these items are so similar, they possibly come from the same factory in China and have different brand names printed on the side.</p>
		
		<h3>Soap Holder</h3>
		
		<p>I’m going to keep the final travel item section brief as frankly neither you or I find soap holders particularly interesting I assume. The one I bought from the store was from “TravelShop”, the same brand as the luggage scale. It cost only 59p and the design couldn’t really be any more simple, although it looks perfectly reasonable for the job.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon has a habit of selling cheap items in bulk as I suppose this makes shipping more economically viable for Amazon and those selling on the platform. This complicates things slightly as usually you don’t really want multiple of the item. Anyway, the cheapest equivalent I found on Amazon was £4.59 for a pack of 2 from “SoftcuteLee”, one of my favourite brands (who?!)</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		
		<p>In conclusion, none of the products I bought in store were any cheaper on Amazon, and some of them were more than twice as expensive before delivery costs are factored in. Additionally, when it comes to buying cheaper products such as adaptors and more so soap holders, many of them are sold as bundles which even then doesn’t save you any money per item bought and you might not even need another.</p>
		
		<p>The three travel items cost me £6.57 total from Home Bargains. The closest/ cheapest alternative items from Amazon would cost £16.57 (excluding delivery which would probably be another £5 approx).</p>
		
		<p>The point of this article isn’t to discredit Amazon’s benefits and convenience, however it does show how you could potentially save a lot of money buying elsewhere and I personally find Amazon the more expensive option in my cases.</p>
